                        <p class="text-format">The Peguero Sister’s ministry began by taking a giant step: 2,100 miles to be exact. Relocated from their native country, Dominican Republic, the Peguero Sisters, along with their mother and father, embarked on a journey that would change their lives forever.

                        Roberto (father) and Maryluz (mother) Peguero took a step of faith into God’s plan when Roberto was offered the opportunity to pastor a new church located in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Through many restless nights and indecisions, both Roberto and Maryluz decided it was time to start living out God’s true purpose, not only for themselves, but for their daughters as well.</p>

                        <p  class="text-format">Fast forward sixteen years and the Peguero Sisters, under the instruction and care of their loving parents, proclaim God’s love to ALL men and women, and uplift broken spirits through their harmonies. Inspired by their Hispanic roots, a dash of Southern Gospel, and a sprinkle of jazz influences, the Peguero Sisters, are accompanied by their father and local guitarist Matthew Hillman, and, on occasion, their mother joins along in song.</p>

                        <p class="text-format">“Our goal isn’t to take, take, take from our audiences,” says Rissel (20), “Our goal is to give back what has been given to us by God, and through that experience we hope to heal broken hearts and rekindle that thing called faith.”

                        <br>

                        The Peguero Sister’s wish is to continue on this journey, wherever it may take them and their family, in hopes of bringing more lives to Christ through song.</p>
